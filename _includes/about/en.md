Hey, I'm **「 Greenhill 」** (青山,@zlon.eth), <del>**a ranger**</del> an ordinary person who likes to think and share.


<del>**Missing it**</del> going through thousands of mountains and rivers, ***`only philosophy and beauty can't live up to it`*** . Some people yearn for poetry and the distance, some people only love poetry and wine pastoral. I don’t like to drink, and I don’t like to travel far. The worst thing is that I don’t know how to write poetry. <del>**I can copy homework**</del>, I can only watch the flowers bloom and fall in front of the pavilion, <del>**and move myself**</del> .


I hope everyone can grow up to be what they wanted to be ***when they were young***, 我们已经没有时间了！<del>**we're out of moutai**</del> !


##### <del>The thief of the years,</del> stealing a poem by Lu You and sharing it with <sup>every</sup><sub>one</sub> :

>家住苍烟落照间，丝毫尘事不相关。<br>
 斟残玉瀣行穿竹，卷罢黄庭卧看山。<br>
 贪啸傲，任衰残，不妨随处一开颜。<br>
 元知造物心肠别，老却英雄似等闲！
